Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "Yesterdays" by Jerome Kern.

<!--more-->

*Yesterdays* was composed by Jerome Kern in 1933. The song follows a 16 bar form and is originally in the key of D minor. This is an analysis of the harmony in *Yesterdays* and an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will explore in more detail below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/yesterdays) for free.

The first four bars of this piece have a minor *i --- ii --- V* cadence repeated twice. This is followed by *i-7* again and a *#VII* augmented chord, which can be thought of as a chromatic passing chord or as a simplified inversion of *i-(Δ7)*. This is followed by a *i-7/VII* which is the third inversion of *i-7*. The last two bars of the first 8 bar section have the *ii/V* and *V7/V* chords, which lead us to the *V7*.

The final 8 bars of this piece are mostly just an extended series of sequential dominants. The V7 leads to *V7/VI* which leads to *V7/VII*, which goes to *VII7* to *V7/VI*. This finally resolves on a *VIΔ7* followed by the *ii --- V* cadence in the key leading back to the top of the piece.
