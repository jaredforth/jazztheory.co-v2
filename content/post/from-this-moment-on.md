*From This Moment On* was written by Cole Porter in 1950. The song follows an AABC form and was originally in the key of Ab. This is an analysis of the harmony in *From This Moment On* and an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will explore in more detail below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/from-this-moment-on) for free.

The **A** section is centered around the relative minor *vi* chord (F minor if in the key of Ab)*.* The first four bars are simply a *i-vi-ii-V* in relation to the *vi.* This is followed by a *ii-vi* before going to a *ii-V-I of IV*. This is followed by a *bVII* leading to the *I* before a *ii-V* of *vi* turnaround. The second ending is a *ii-V* of *IV* leading to the **B** section.

The B section goes from *IV* to *bVII* to *I* to *iii* to *VI* before hanging out on essentially an extended *V.* There is a brief *ii-V* of *V* before going back to *V* and then a *V* of *vi* leading into the **C** section.

The **C** section (shown in Page 2) is identical to **A** until the final 6 measures. Here, there is a diatonic cycle of fourths beginning with *iii* and going to *VI, II, V, I.*Â
