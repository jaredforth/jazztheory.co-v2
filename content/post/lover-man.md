Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)" by Jimmy Davis.

<!--more-->


*Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)* was composed by Jimmy Davis in 1942. The song follows an *AABA* form and is originally in the key of *C major*. This is an analysis of the harmony in *Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)* and an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will walk through below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/lover-man) for free.

### Section A

Section A begins with two parallel ii --- V cadences that each are repeated twice. The first is *ii --- V of V* repeated twice and the second is *ii --- V* in the key. This is followed by I7 which to my ear sounds like it is functioning as V7/IV. IV7 is the next chord, which can be thought of as a modal interchange chord borrowed from the Dorian mode. This is followed by *subV7/V*, *V7*, and *I*Δ7 with *ii --- V of vi* turnaround leading back to the repeat of A.

### Section B

Section B opens with a diatonic *iii-7* to *V7* and a brief modulation of a major second up to D for a measure and a half with *IΔ7 --- bVII7 --- vi-7* before going back to *ii --- V of ii* in the original key. This is followed by ii --- V leading to *I*Δ7 --- bVII7 and another ii --- V of vi turnaround leading into the final A section. On beat 3 of the fifth measure of the B section there is a *ii-7(#5)* chord, which functions the same as the *ii-7* preceding it just with some added color. The *IΔ7 --- bVII7* cadence that happens twice can be thought of as a borrowed chord from Aeolian.
