### Analysis

Although this song seems simple harmonically, it is a beautiful composition and is an amazing vehicle for improvisation. It is in a minor key and the first several measures alternate between the *i-7* and *V7* in a perfect cadence. The end of measure 4 goes to the *V7/iv* tonicizing the *iv* before going to *iv-7.* The next chord is the *VI7*,which could be thought of as a modal interchange chord from A Locrian. This is followed by a *ii-7(b5), V7, i-7* in the key before repeating the *V7, i-7* cadence. The last line has a secondary dominant V7/VII before a *VII7, IIIΔ7, i-7*. This is followed by a *ii-7(b5), V7, i-7* before the *V7, i-7* turnaround leading back to the top.
