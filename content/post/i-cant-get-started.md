Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "I Can't Get Started (With You)" by Vernon Duke.

![I Can't Get Started Harmonic Analysis](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GIk5h7hMDFuGRjwbivlAfA.png)

*I Can't Get Started* was composed by Vernon Duke in 1936. The original key is *C* and the song follows a 32-bar *AABA* form. This is a harmonic analysis of the changes in *I Can't Get Started*, along with an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will walk through below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) for a deeper exploration of the analytic concepts used and [get the PDF for free](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/i-cant-get-started).

### Section A

This song begins with a *I --- vi --- ii --- V* progression followed by a secondary dominant cycle of fourths progression *V7/vi --- vi --- V7/V --- V.* This is followed by another *I --- vi --- ii --- V* followed by another secondary dominant fourths cycle *V7/vi --- V7/ii--- V7/V --- V.* The repeat is the same with the exemption of the second minor plagal ending of *I --- iv --- I*. 

### Section B

Section B modulates a major second up to D at the beginning. In the new key, we have two ii --- V cadences followed by a *I --- IV 7--- iii --- ii --- V* and a *I --- IV7.* The final three measures are back in the original key. These measures have *ii --- V --- iii --- biii --- ii --- V* before going back to the last repeat of A.
