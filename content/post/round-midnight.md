Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "'Round Midnight" by Thelonius Monk.

<!--more-->

*'Round Midnight* was composed by Thelonius Monk in 1944. The song has an AABA form and was originally in Eb minor. This is an analysis of the harmony in '*Round Midnight* and an explanation of concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows the full analysis which will be further explored below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/round-midnight) for free.

### High-Level Observations

This is a fairly difficult piece to analyze functionally because Monk sometimes uses chords in a more coloristic than functional manner. However, I have tried to perform a functional analysis to try and uncover some of the harmonic structure of the tune. 

### Section A

The song begins on the *i-7* tonic with a descending chromatic bassline. This is followed by the natural sixth *-7(b5)* from melodic minor and the *iv-7, VII7* (which is the *ii-7, V7* of the relative major, *Gb*). This *ii --- V* does not resolve though, and we go back to the natural sixth scale degree for a related *ii --- V* of *V*. This does not resolve either and the next measure has a *ii --- V of #iv* followed by a *ii --- V of iv.* The last V7 actually resolves to the *iv-7* and is followed by the *VII7* leading to the *IIIΔ7.* This can also be thought of as a *ii-V-I* in Gb major. The *IV7* is borrowed from the melodic minor after this and is followed by *ii --- V* of *V* and *ii --- V* in the key to lead back to the tonic on the repeat of section A. 

### Section A'

The repeat of section A is the same until the second ending. This ending has a *ii --- V* of *V* and *ii --- V* but then resolves to the *IΔ7* borrowed from the parallel major. 

### Section B 

Section B opens with a *ii --- V* of *V* that goes to the *V7*. This cadence repeats before going to a *vi-7* and the *ii --- V* in the key. The next three measures cycle in fourths from the *ii --- V* of *V*, *ii --- V* of *iv*, and *iv --- VII* (the *ii --- V* of *Gb* major). The last measure has the *ii --- V of ♭ii* followed by the *ii --- V* leading back to the tonic of section A. 

### Section A''

The last repeat of section A is identical to A' but the last measure resolves to *i-7* instead of *IΔ7.*
