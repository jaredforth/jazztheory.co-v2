Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "Body and Soul" by Johnny Green. 

<!--more-->

*Body and Soul* was composed by Johnny Green in 1930. The original key is *Db* and the song follows a 32-bar *AABA* form. This is a jazz harmonic analysis of the changes in *Body and Soul*, along with an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will walk through below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) for a deeper exploration of the analytic concepts used and [get the PDF for free](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/body-and-soul).

### Section A

At the beginning of section A is a *ii-7, V7/ii-7, ii-7* cadence. The *V7/ii-7* is a secondary dominant that briefly tonicizes the *ii* but the piece does not modulate. Measure 2 has a subdominant, dominant, tonic cadence expressed as a *ii-7, V7, IΔ7* which is followed by the *Gb9* chord on beat 3 of measure 3.

I chose to mark the *Gb9* as a tritone substitution of the secondary dominant V7/iii, but it could be thought of as a chord borrowed from a modal exchange because it is the IV, just a dominant 7 instead of a Δ7. We could think of this as coming from Db Dorian or Db Melodic Minor because both of these scales create a IV chord with a b7. We could also think of this as just a passing chord leading chromatically to the diatonic *iii-7*, which is *F-7* in this case. We use our outline arrow here to represent a *V7* resolving down a half step.

The *iii-7*, *F-7*, is followed by a passing diminished chord (*biiio7*) to lead to the subdominant *ii-7*. Measure 6 begins with a *ii-7(b5), V7* secondary dominant with a related *ii-7* cadence going to the *vi-7*. We then have a *ii, V, I* followed by a *ii, V* secondary dominant leading back to the *ii-7*.

The second ending for the second time through the A section has a *ii-7, V7* modulating to the key of D for the B section.

### Section B

This section begins with a diatonic *IΔ7, ii-7, iii-7* progression in the new key of D. The next *G-6* chord is a *iv-*, so it is not in the key. This can be thought of as a modal interchange chord borrowing from the Aeolian mode. The next measure is just a diatonic *iii, vi, ii, V* turnaround leading back to the tonic. Here we have the new "to minor" symbol where the DΔ7 leads to the D-7. The piece also modulates to C here, and the *D-7* is the first of a *ii-7, V7* in C. Instead of resolving to a C, the weeker tonic sound of *iii-7* is used. We then have a passing *biii* diminished chord leading to another *ii-7, V7.* The V7 here does not resolve to the tonic, but rather to a I7. This could be thought of as a modal interchange chord from C Mixolydian but I marked it as the secondary dominant *V7/IV*. The next chord could be thought of as a passing chord or as a tritone substitution of the *V7/IV*. The final *Bb7* is the *V7/ii-7* in the key of Db, which leads us back to section A.
