![What Is This Thing Called Love Jazz Harmonic Analysis](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1Myx1XAUhF0CKXLJJKm82w.png)

*What Is This Thing Called Love* was composed by Cole Porter in 1929. The song follows a 32 bar *AABA* form and is originally in the key of *C major*. This is an analysis of the harmony in *What is This Thing Called Love* and an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will explore in more detail below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/wittcl) for free.

### Overview

Although *What Is This Thing Called Love* is mostly comprised of relatively simple sequences of *ii --- V --- I* cadences, Porter uses borrowed chords extensively to create an ambiguous harmonic backdrop for his singable melody. The original key is C major, but chords are borrowed from the parallel C minor throughout. There are some unexpected resolutions throughout, notably at the end of section A where a minor *ii --- V* resolves to a major *I*. The harmonic characteristics of this tune make it great for improvisation and create an interesting analysis. 

### Section A

The tune opens with *ii --- V of IV*. However, this is a minor *ii-7(b5) --- V7(b9)* that resolves to *iv-7*. The minor *iv* can be thought of as a borrowed chord from the parallel minor. This is followed by another minor *ii-7(b5) --- V7* that resolves somewhat unexpectedly to the *I* major. 

### Section B

Section B begins with a brief modulation into Bb, the *bVII* of C. It begins with a C minor to F7 cadence, which I wrote as *ii --- V/ bVII.* The *ii --- V* resolves to the *bVII* for two bars before a move down a step to the *bVI*. A *ii-7(b5) --- V7(b9)* in the original key leads back to the final repeat of section A.
