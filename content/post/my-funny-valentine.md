Harmonic analysis of the jazz standard "My Funny Valentine" by Richard Rodgers.

![My Funny Valentine: Jazz Harmonic Analysis](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sXOhGvmSM-ymUrvOXqPYfg.png)

*My Funny Valentine* was composed by Richard Rodgers in 1937. The song follows an *AA₁BC* form and is originally in the key of *C minor / Eb major*. This is an analysis of the harmony in *My Funny Valentine* and an explanation of the concepts used in the analysis. The image above shows my full analysis, which I will walk through below. You can refer to the [conventions page](https://jazztheory.co/conventions-theory/) to explore the analytic concepts used or [get the PDF](https://jaredforth.gumroad.com/l/my-funny-valentine) for free.

### General Comments

I want to note two things before digging into the analysis. The first is that several alternate changes are sometimes played over this tune. I have put some common alternate changes a line above the more standard changes. The roman numeral analyses for these alternate changes are a line below the roman numeral analysis corresponding to the standard changes. The second is that I chose to think of the entire piece as being in Eb major, so I have notated *C-* as the *vi*. Another valid way to think about this tune is thinking of the A and C sections as being in C minor and the B section in Eb major. With this approach, *C-* would be the *i*, *D-7(b5)* would be the *ii*, *G7* would be the *V7*, etc. To simplify the analysis a bit I have chosen to think of the C minor as *vi*, but thinking of it as *i* is also a good approach. It's really about whatever approach makes the most sense to you. 

### Section A

The first four measures of this tune feature a classic minor cliche of the minor (-), minor (-Δ7) major seven, minor seven (-7), minor six (-6). This creates a descending chromatic line from the root to the sixth. Alternate changes feature an *ii --- V* of the *vi* in measure 2 and an *II7* in measure 4. The next four bars go from the *IVΔ7* to the *ii --- 7* to an *ii --- V* of *vi* turnaround leading into the repeat of A. The second A is the same with the exception of the last two measures, which are *ii --- V* leading to the *IΔ7* of section B.

### Section B 

Section B begins with an *I-ii-I/3* progression that repeats twice. On the second repeat, the first inversion of the *I* is replaced by *V7/vi.* This is followed by the *vi*, *ii --- V* of *IV,* and *ii --- V* of *vi* leading to section C. 

### Section C

The first five measures of section C are the same as A. This section deviates in the sixth measure of the section with *ii* --- *V/vi* leading to *vi*. This is followed by *vi --- subV/V* and *ii/IV --- subV/IV*. The *subV* notation here signifies a tritone substitution of the *V7* of the target chord. This is followed by the *IVΔ7* and *ii --- V --- I* in the key. A turnaround of *ii-7/vi --- V7/vi* leads back to the top of the song on a repeat.
