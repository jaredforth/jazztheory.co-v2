This website is dedicated to learning jazz theory through analyzing standards. The purpose of this site is to provide resources for learning the language of jazz through a study of the literature. There are hundreds of jazz standards, and a thorough study of these standards can teach much about the harmony, melody, and structure of the art form. This site is a work in progress and is continually being updated with more tunes.
