title: "Harmonic Function"
---

In music theory, a harmonic function is based on three high-level categories. These categories are traditionally called *tonic (****T****)*, *subdominant* (**SD**--- also called *predominant* (**PD**)), and *dominant* (**D**). Each function has associated diatonic scale degrees and more or less perceived tension. 

### Tonic

The tonic is the *least dissonant* state of diatonic harmony. Tonic chords feel as though they are at rest and complete. The tonic scale degrees are *I* (the strongest), *iii*, and *vi*. In the key of C, these would be **C**Δ7, **E-7**, and **B-7**.

### Subdominant (Predominant) 

The subdominant (sometimes also called predominant) has a medium level of dissonance. Subdominant chords feel as though they have a certain level of tension, but are not intolerably tense or dissonant. The subdominant scale degrees are *IV* and *ii*. In C, these are **F**Δ7and **D-7**.

### Dominant

The dominant has the maximum level of dissonance in the diatonic framework. This is due to the interval of a tritone between the 4th and 7th scale degrees (F and B in the key of C). Dominant chords feel like they need to resolve and have a high level of unrest. The dominant scale degrees are **V** and **vii** (some theorists do not include this chord). In C, these are **G7** and **Bo7**. 

### SD --- D --- T

The most fundamental cadence in traditional, tonal jazz is the subdominant-dominant-tonic progression. This primarily takes the form **ii-7, V7, IΔ7**. This progression goes from a state of medium tension to maximum tension to rest. Functionally, the progressions **IVΔ7, V7, IΔ7**, and **ii-7, V7, vi-7**, as well as other instances of tonic (such as **iii-7**) will retain the same functional sound. 

In this publication, these functions will be listed below the staff underneath the [roman numeral analysis](https://jazztheory.co/harmonic-analysis-symbols/#roman-numerals).
